# 100 Days of Code Challenge

This repository contains my daily progress and log for the challenge. Join me on this coding journey as I commit to coding for 100 consecutive days to improve my skills and build exciting projects.

## Motivation

I decided to take up the 100 days of code challenge to challenge myself and make coding a daily habit. By dedicating time every day to code, I aim to enhance my programming skills, learn new technologies, and build practical projects along the way.

## Rules

The rules for my 100 days of code challenge are as follows:

1. Code for at least one hour every day.
2. Document my progress and learnings in the [log.md](log.md) file.
3. Share my daily progress on social media (optional).
4. Encourage and support fellow participants in their coding journeys.

## Log
